# House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

## Task 3 – AI & ML Internship (Elevate Labs)
###  Objective
To build a simple & multiple linear regression model using real housing data to predict house prices.

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

### Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Encoded categorical variables
3. Trained a Linear Regression model
4. Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, R² score
5. Visualized Actual vs Predicted prices

### Key Observations
- Linear regression performed reasonably well for housing prediction
- `Area`, `Bedrooms`, and `Bathrooms` were used as features
- R² score shows model effectiveness (~ closer to 1 is better)

### Dataset Source
[House Price Prediction Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

### Outcome
Successfully completed as part of Task 3 in the Elevate Labs Internship.
