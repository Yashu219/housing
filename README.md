# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

## Task 3 – AI & ML Internship (Elevate Labs)

### 📌 Objective
To build a simple and multiple linear regression model using real housing data to predict house prices.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

### 📊 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the housing dataset
2. Encoded categorical variables (like 'yes'/'no' to 1/0)
3. Selected key features: `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`
4. Split data into training and testing sets (80-20 split)
5. Trained a Linear Regression model
6. Made predictions on test data
7. Evaluated model using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
8. Visualized actual vs. predicted prices

---

### 🔍 Key Observations
- The model uses `area`, `bedrooms`, and `bathrooms` to predict prices.
- Linear regression performed reasonably well.
- Room and bathroom count significantly affect house prices.
- Adding more features (like `stories`, `furnishingstatus`, `airconditioning`) could improve accuracy.
